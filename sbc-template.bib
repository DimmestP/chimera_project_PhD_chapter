   abstract = {The construction of new plasmid DNA species by in vitro joining of restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of separate plasmids is described. Newly constructed plasmids that are inserted into Esch-erichia coli by transformation are shown to be biologically functional replicons that possess genetic properties and nucleotide base sequences from both of the parent DNA molecules. Functional plasmids can be obtained by reassociation of endonuclease-generated fragments of larger replicons, as well as by joining of plasmid DNA molecules of entirely different origins. Controlled shearing of antibiotic resistance (R) factor DNA leads to formation of plasmid DNA segments that can be taken up by appropriately treated Escherichia coli cells and that recircularize to form new, autonomously replicating plasmids (1). One such plasmid that is formed after transformation of E. coli by a fragment of sheared R6-5 DNA, pSC101 (previously referred to as Tc6-5), has a molecular weight of 5.8 X 106, which represents about 10% of the genome of the parent R factor. This plasmid carries genetic information necessary for its own replication and for expression of resistance to tetracycline, but lacks the other drug resistance determinants and the fertility functions carried by R6-5 (1). Two recently described restriction endonucleases, EcoRI and EcoRII, cleave double-stranded DNA so as to produce short overlapping single-stranded ends. The nucleotide sequences cleaved are unique and self-complementary (2-6) so that DNA fragments produced by one of these enzymes can associate by hydrogen-bonding with other fragments produced by the same enzyme. After hydrogen-bonding, the 3'-hydroxyl and 5'-phosphate ends can be joined by DNA ligase (6). Thus, these restriction endonucleases appeared to have great potential value for the construction of new plasmid species by joining DNA molecules from different sources. The EcoRI endonuclease seemed especially useful for this purpose, because on a random basis the sequence cleaved is expected to occur only about once for every 4,000 to 16,000 nucleotide pairs (2); thus, most EcoRI-generated DNA fragments should contain one or more intact genes. We describe here the construction of new plasmid DNA species by in vitro association of the EcoRI-derived DNA fragments from separate plasmids. In one instance a new plasmid has been constructed from two DNA species of entirely different origin, while in another, a plasmid which has itself been derived from EcoRI-generated DNA fragments of a larger parent plasmid genome has been joined to another rep-licon derived independently from the same parent plasmid. Plasmids that have been constructed by the in vitro joining of 3240 EcoRI-generated fragments have been inserted into appropriately treated E. coli by transformation (7) and have been shown to form biologically functional replicons that possess genetic properties and nucleotide base sequences of both parent DNA species. MATERIALS AND METHODS E. coli strain W1485 containing the RSF1010 plasmid, which carries resistance to streptomycin and sulfonamide, was obtained from S. Falkow. Other bacterial strains and R factors and procedures for DNA isolation, electron microscopy, and transformation of E. coli by plasmid DNA have been described (1, 7, 8). Purification and use of the EcoRI restriction endonuclease have been described (5). Plasmid hetero-duplex studies were performed as previously described (9, 10). E. coli DNA ligase was a gift from P. Modrich and R. L. Lehman and was used as described (11). The detailed procedures for gel electrophoresis of DNA will be described elsewhere (Helling, Goodman, and Boyer, in preparation); in brief, duplex DNA was subjected to electrophoresis in a tube-type apparatus (Hoefer Scientific Instrument) (0.6 X 15-cm gel) at about 200 in 0.7% agarose at 22.5 V with 40 mM Tris-acetate buffer (pH 8.05) containing 20 mM sodium acetate , 2 mM EDTA, and 18 mM sodium chloride. The gels were then soaked in ethidium bromide (5 ,g/ml) and the DNA was visualized by fluorescence under long wavelength ultraviolet light ("black light"). The molecular weight of each fragment in the range of 1 to 200 X 105 was determined from its mobility relative to the mobilities of DNA standards of known molecular weight included in the same gel (Helling, Goodman, and Boyer, in preparation). RESULTS R6-5 and pSC101 plasmid DNA preparations were treated with the EcoRI restriction endonuclease, and the resulting DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis in agarose gels. Photographs of the fluorescing DNA bands derived from these plasmids are presented in Fig. lb and c. Only one band is observed after EcoRI endonucleolytic digestion of pSC101 DNA (Fig. 1c), suggesting that this plasmid has a single site susceptible to cleavage by the enzyme. In addition, endonuclease-treated pSC101 DNA is located at the position in the gel that would be.expected if the covalently closed circular plasmid is cleaved once to form noncircular DNA of the same molecular weight. The molecular weight of the linear fragment estimated from its mobility in the gel is 5.8 X 106, in agreement with independent measurements of the size of the intact molecule (1). Because pSC101 has a single EcoRI cleavage site and is derived from R6-5, the equivalent DNA sequences of},

With phage T7 DNA as substrate the endonuclease introduces a limited number (about 40) double-strand breaks (5′-phosphoryl, 3′-hydroxyl). The limit product has an average length of about 1000 nucleotide pairs and contains no single-strand breaks. We have explored the nucleotide sequences at the 5′-ends of the limit product by labeling the 5′- phosphoryl groups (using polynucleotide kinase) and characterizing the labeled fragments released by various nucleases. Two classes of 5′-terminal sequences were obtained: pApApCpNp ... (60%) and pGpApCpNp ... (40%), where N indicates that the base in the 4th position is not unique. The dinucleoside monophosphates at the 3′-ends were isolated after micrococcal nuclease digestion of the limit product and identified as TpT(60%) and TpC (40%). We conclude that endonuclease R of H. influenzae recognizes the following specific nucleotide sequence: 5′ ... pGpTpPy |pPupApCp ... 3′ 3′ ... pCpApPup |PypTpGp ... 5′ The implications of the twofold rotational symmetry of this sequence are discussed. © 1970.},

However, these behaviours have not been demonstrated in networks of non-specialized regulatory components. Here we present the construction of a genetic toggle switch—a synthetic, bistable gene-regulatory network—in Escherichia coli and provide a simple theory that predicts the conditions necessary for bistability. The toggle is constructed from any two repressible promoters arranged in a mutually inhibitory network. It is flipped between stable states using transient chemical or thermal induction and exhibits a nearly ideal switching threshold. As a practical device, the toggle switch forms a synthetic, addressable cellular memory unit and has implications for biotechnology, biocomputing and gene therapy.},

Here we present a complementary approach to this problem: the design and construction of a synthetic network to implement a particular function. We used three transcriptional repressor systems that are not part of any natural biological clock3,4,5 to build an oscillating network, termed the repressilator, in Escherichia coli. The network periodically induces the synthesis of green fluorescent protein as a readout of its state in individual cells. The resulting oscillations, with typical periods of hours, are slower than the cell-division cycle, so the state of the oscillator has to be transmitted from generation to generation. This artificial clock displays noisy behaviour, possibly because of stochastic fluctuations of its components. Such ‘rational network design’ may lead both to the engineering of new cellular behaviours and to an improved understanding of naturally occurring networks.},

However, frequently they cannot meet practical requirements due to insufficient sensing performance. To address this issue, we investigated a modular, cascaded signal amplifying methodology. We first tuned intracellular sensory receptor densities to increase sensitivity, and then engineered multi-layered transcriptional amplifiers to sequentially boost output expression level. We demonstrated these strategies by engineering ultrasensitive bacterial sensors for arsenic and mercury, and improved detection limit and output up to 5,000-fold and 750-fold, respectively. Coupled by leakage regulation approaches, we developed an encapsulated microbial sensor cell array for low-cost, portable and precise field monitoring, where the analyte can be readily quantified via displaying an easy-to-interpret volume bar-like pattern. The ultrasensitive signal amplifying methodology along with the background regulation and the sensing platform will be widely applicable to many other cell-based sensors, paving the way for their real-world applications. An engineered biosensor, which optimizes metal-sensing and couples it to transcriptional amplification cascades that produce a fluorescent protein, was applied to build a sensitive and easy-to-use sensor for the toxic metals As3+ and Hg2+.},

The biosensor is based on a plasmid incorporating the transcriptional activator xylR from the TOL plasmid of Pseudomonas putida mt-2. The XylR protein binds a subset of toluene-like compounds and activates transcription at its promoter, P(u). A reporter plasmid was constructed by placing the luc gene for firefly luciferase under the control of XyIR and P(u). When Escherichia coli cells were transformed with this plasmid vector, luminescence from the cells was induced in the presence of benzene, toluene, xylenes, and similar molecules. Accurate concentration dependencies of luminescence were obtained and exhibited K( 1/4 ) values ranging from 39.0 ± 3.8 μM for 3-xylene to 2,690 ± 160 μM for 3-methylbenzylalcohol (means ± standard deviations). The luminescence response was specific for only toluene-like molecules that bind to and activate XyIR. The biosensor cells were field tested on deep aquifer water, for which contaminant levels were known, and were able to accurately detect toluene derivative contamination in this water. The biosensor cells were also shown to detect BETX (benzene, toluene, and xylene) contamination in soil samples. These results demonstrate the capability of such a bacterial biosensor to accurately measure environmental contaminants and suggest a potential for its inexpensive application in field-ready assays.},

   abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) is a flavivirus that was first identified in 1947. Initially, the virus was of little concern for health authorities given there were very few casualties among those suffering an infection. As such, only limited studies were performed on ZIKV. Recently, the viral infection has been linked to microcephaly in infants, which has prompted a dramatic increase in scientific interest in ZIKV research, including methods to allow for rapid virus identification. In this work we report the development of a new type of ZIKV electrochemical biosensor based on surface imprinted polymers and graphene oxide composites. The biosensor was used to detect ZIKV by measuring changes in the electrical signal with changing virus concentrations in buffer and serum using standard electrochemical techniques. The detection limit of our method is similar to the detection limit of the real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR method.},

   abstract = {Control of gene and protein expression of both endogenous and heterologous genes is a key component of metabolic engineering. While a large amount of work has been published characterizing promoters for this purpose, less effort has been exerted to elucidate the role of terminators in yeast. In this study, we characterize over 30 terminators for use in metabolic engineering applications in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and determine {mRNA} half-life changes to be the major cause of the varied protein and transcript expression level. We demonstrate that the difference in transcript level can be over 6.5-fold even for high strength promoters. The influence of terminator selection is magnified when coupled with a low-expression promoter, with a maximum difference in protein expression of 11-fold between an expression-enhancing terminator and the parent plasmid terminator and over 35-fold difference when compared with a no-terminator baseline. This is the first time that terminators have been investigated in the context of multiple promoters spanning orders of magnitude in activity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of terminator selection for metabolic engineering by using a mutant xylose isomerase gene as a proof-of-concept. Through pairing an expression-enhancing terminator with a low-expression promoter, we were able to achieve the same phenotypic result as with a promoter considerably higher in strength. Moreover, we can further boost the phenotype of the high-strength promoter by pairing it with an expression-enhancing terminator. This work highlights how terminator elements can be used to control metabolic pathways in the same way that promoters are traditionally used in yeast. Together, this work demonstrates that terminators will be an important part of heterologous gene expression and metabolic engineering for yeast in the future. © 2013 Elsevier Inc..},

While 3’ end sequences contribute to expression differences through a variety of mechanisms including {mRNA} stability and regulation of translation, we find a predominant effect of {mRNA} 3’ end processing efficiency. Using extensive designed mutagenesis analysis we find that out of three functional elements described in the literature as comprising the polyadenylation signal, a single element (known as the efficiency element) is responsible for most of the effect on protein expression levels. Our work highlights the importance of 3’ end processing in expression regulation and facilitates the incorporation of the effect of this region into more complete models of DNA encoded gene expression regulation.},

    abstract = {Synthetic biology builds upon the foundation of engineering principles, prompting innovation and improvement in biotechnology via a design-build-test-learn cycle. A community-wide standard in DNA assembly would enable bio-molecular engineering at the levels of predictivity and universality in design and construction that are comparable to other engineering fields. Golden Gate Assembly technology, with its robust capability to unidirectionally assemble numerous DNA fragments in a one-tube reaction, has the potential to deliver a universal standard framework for DNA assembly. While current Golden Gate Assembly frameworks (e.g. MoClo and Golden Braid) render either high cloning capacity or vector toolkit simplicity, the technology can be made more versatile—simple, streamlined, and cost/labor-efficient, without compromising capacity. Here we report the development of a new Golden Gate Assembly framework named Mobius Assembly, which combines vector toolkit simplicity with high cloning capacity. It is based on a two-level, hierarchical approach and utilizes a low-frequency cutter to reduce domestication requirements. Mobius Assembly embraces the standard overhang designs designated by MoClo, Golden Braid, and Phytobricks and is largely compatible with already available Golden Gate part libraries. In addition, dropout cassettes encoding chromogenic proteins were implemented for cost-free visible cloning screening that color-code different cloning levels. As proofs of concept, we have successfully assembled up to 16 transcriptional units of various pigmentation genes in both operon and multigene arrangements. Taken together, Mobius Assembly delivers enhanced versatility and efficiency in DNA assembly, facilitating improved standardization and automation.},

   abstract = {The DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) content per cell, according to some recent investigations, is a constant for the various somatic cells of an organism, and sperm cells contain one-hail this amount per ceU (1, 2). The quantity of DNA per cell is a characteristic of each organism. In this work, done independentiy by two groups of investigators, the DNA per ceLl was found by determining the quantity of DNA in a suspension containing a known number of ceUs and then dividing the total DNA by the number of cells. For sperm and erythrocytes the cells themselves were counted; for tissue cells isolated nuclei were prepared, analyzed, and counted. Knowledge concerning the DNA content per cell has been extended along two lines. On the one hand, more examples have been brought forward. In the original work, for example, the DNA contents of erythrocytes, liver ceUs, and sperm of fowl were determined and DNA determinations for cells of fowl kidney, spleen, heart, and pancreas have now been added by Davidson and his colleagues (3). These results are given in Table I. In a series of careful measurements by Davison and Osgood on human granulocytes and lymphocytes (from leukemic blood), two quite different cell types, the DNA per cell of the former was found to be 6.25 X 10-0 rag. and that of the latter 5.84 × 10-0 rag. (4). Our own determinations on human sperm gave 2.72 X 10-9 mg. per cell, approximately one-half the value for the somatic cells. Another line of investigation has been to determine by a cytochemical procedure the DNA content per nucleus (5). In this procedure it is possible to make determinations on single nuclei, either as isolated cells and nuclei or in tissue sections. It has been found that the Feulgen nucleal reaction gives reproducible results and that a microphotometric observation serves as a measure of DNA content. The essential requirement in this procedure is a standard of known DNA content and heretofore none was available. A whole series of standards was provided by the work mentioned above in which DNA per nucleus was determined chemically. One set of standards consisted of nucleated * Dr. Ris' present address is:},
